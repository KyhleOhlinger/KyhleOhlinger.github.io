Chatbots have come a long way from early rule-based systems. Today’s generative AI and LLMs - like OpenAI’s GPT-4 - make it possible to build intelligent, responsive chatbots with minimal coding. This blog post was created to showcase the method that Jason Haddix has been implementing in his own personal methodology as described in the  [OWASP 2024 Keynote: Red, Blue, and Purple AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHeTn7uWVQM). If you haven't watched the talk, I highly recommend it!  

By leveraging the methodology described in his talk, I created a replica "System Bot" which can automatically generate, iterate, and even “self-replicate” chatbots with remarkable speed and accuracy. I have created a number of bots mentioned in this post using the "System Bot" and have included the [prompt](https://github.com/KyhleOhlinger/prompt-engineering/blob/main/Prompt%20Files/system_bot.md) and [Python code](https://github.com/KyhleOhlinger/prompt-engineering/blob/main/Python%20Scripts/vertex_ai_runner.py) to generate the bots on [my GitHub](https://github.com/KyhleOhlinger). 


# Getting Started: What You Need to Know
The landscape of chatbot development has evolved significantly, making it more accessible than ever. Before diving in, here are some key concepts to understand:
- **Types of Chatbots:** Chatbots can be broadly classified into two categories:
    - _Rule-based chatbots_ operate on predefined scripts and decision trees, offering predictable yet limited responses.
    - _AI-powered chatbots_ leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate dynamic, context-aware responses, improving user interactions.
- **Key Benefits of AI-Powered Chatbots:**
    - **Faster Development Cycles:** Traditional chatbot development required months of programming, but AI-powered chatbots can be deployed rapidly with minimal coding.
    - **Lower Cost of Updates:** AI models can improve over time without costly manual updates.
    - **Enhanced Personalization:** LLM-based chatbots can analyze user input to provide tailored responses, improving engagement.
    - **Scalability:** AI chatbots can handle an increasing volume of queries without requiring proportional increases in human resources.
- **Pre-built AI Platforms:** Developers can now integrate state-of-the-art AI models via APIs. Popular options include:
    - **OpenAI’s & Anthropic's API** – Powering ChatGPT-based bots
    - **Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service** – Offering enterprise-grade AI chatbot solutions
    - **Google’s Vertex AI** – Providing cloud-based AI models for conversational applications
- **Choosing the Right AI Model:** Each AI model comes with unique strengths:
    - **ChatGPT (OpenAI):** Strong conversational fluency and adaptability across industries.
    - **Gemini (Google DeepMind):** Powerful multimodal capabilities (text, images, etc.).
    - **Claude (Anthropic):** Emphasizes AI safety and ethical responses.
    - **Other Models:** Various open-source models (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral) provide flexibility for custom chatbot development.

These items may not seem all that important but knowing which models are useful for your specific use case (e.g. writing, coding, image generation, etc.) can provide a  boost to your output. When evaluating models, always consider not only the price but also the community support, active forums, and tutorials which can be your best friend when troubleshooting or experimenting.

# Step-by-Step Guide: Leveraging LLMs to Build Your Own Chatbot
During the keynote, an example was provided on how humans think and how to incorporate that into chatbot generation. I have noted down the main concepts below: 

- IDENTITY AND PURPOSE: Give it a persona and make it an expert in its field
- INSTRUCTIONS: this is divided into 2 sections:
  - INSTRUCTIONS-PRE (Weird machine tricks): Contains the state of flow and mindset
  - INSTRUCTIONS-MAIN: Breaks down the problem and provides step-by-step instructions for the bot to follow
- RELATED RESEARCH TERMS FOR YOUR IDENTITY AND INSTRUCTIONS: Related concepts which the AI model can use to fine-tune the output and search criteria
- OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS: The output requirements that you have for the bot
- EXAMPLES: Any examples you have for input and expected output. 

> One of my favourite learnings from his talk was about "Attention" during bot creation. As linked by one of his talks, 3Blue1Brown has a fantastic video on [Attention in Transformers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMlx5fFNoYc&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown).

In addition to the sections mentioned during the keynote (and provided above), I have added in an "IMPROVEMENTS" section which tells the LLM to offer improvement advice to generate better chatbots based on new research into the fields of Prompt Engineering. 

# Quick Tips for Chatbot Success
> Tip: Always test your chatbot early on to identify unexpected behaviors. This helps ensure that the bot remains both engaging and accurate.

- **Iterate Rapidly:** Start with a pilot project and use agile methods for continuous improvement. Engage with online communitie - forums and GitHub repositories can be a gold mine for troubleshooting tips.
- **Focus on Quality Improvements:** Regularly update your Chatbots with new methods for extracting better information. If you are not using a Cloud based system, keep your training data up-to-date to ensure your chatbot remains accurate and relevant.
- **Maintain Human Oversight:** The prompts that the "System Bots", or any other bot for that matter, generate should be used as a starting point and it is up to you to balance automation with human quality checks.
- **Plan for Scalability:** Design modular systems so you can easily add new chatbots or expand functionalities.
- **Seamless Integration:** Ensure that your chatbot works well with your existing systems.

# Conclusion: Your Next Steps in Chatbot Creation
By leveraging LLMs, you can build and scale your own chatbots with significantly reduced costs and development times. Now is the perfect time to start exploring chatbot technology while creating bots for your specific use cases. There is a world of information out there and it’s accessible to anyone with a vision and the willingness to learn. Take the first step: define your use case, gather your data, and choose the right platform. With persistence and continuous improvement, your AI-powered chatbot can become a powerful asset.
