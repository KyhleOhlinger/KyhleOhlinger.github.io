Last year, Microsoft released the second version of the [threat matrix](
https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/21/the-evolution-of-a-matrix-how-attck-for-containers-was-built/) for Kubernetes. Version 2 added new techniques that were found by Microsoft researchers and techniques that were suggested by the community, while also removing several techniques which were no longer relevant. While looking into Kubernetes detections, I needed to map them back to MITRE IDs. I started looking into the current Container framework by [MITRE](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/containers/) and realised that the framework did not include a number of the tactics presented by the Microsoft Kubernetes threat matrix. The reason is detailed within Microsoft's blog post, but I have included an excerpt below:

> ATT&CK focuses on real-world techniques that are seen in the wild. In contrast, many of the techniques in the threat matrix were observed during research work and not necessarily as part of an active attack.

While this made sense, it did not help my situation and I needed to find a way to map the events back to valid MITRE IDs. This post describes the mappings, and I have created a [GitHub page](https://github.com/KyhleOhlinger/K8-Mitre-Mapping) which includes the mappings in a tabular format as well as a description for each TTP for quick reference. 

## Threat Matrix Mappings 
> The MITRE mappings were created by Microsoft and are not officially supported by the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Where possible, mappings from the Microsoft Kubernetes threat matrix to the existing MITRE ATT&CK techniques have been made.

## Stratus Red Team Mappings
In addition to the Microsoft threat matrix mappings, I included mappings for the techniques outlined within the Stratus Red Team [toolkit](https://stratus-red-team.cloud/attack-techniques/list/). However, *Create Client Certificate Credential* was not mapped as the technique does not work on AWS EKS.

## MITRE Containers 

The MITRE ATT&CK IDs provided above were created for a specific purpose and I hope that it can be improved by the community to assist with Kubernetes MITRE mappings. However, the current MITRE Containers matrix should be the defacto for your organisation and is something that all organisations (who use MITRE) should reference. I also believe that everyone should read the Microsoft blog post referenced above, as it is a lot more comprehensive but does not include mappings to MITRE IDs.
