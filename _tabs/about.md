I am currently the Lead Security Engineer within the Security Response Team at [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com/), focusing on the improvement of Wayfair's security baseline through the implementation of preventative and detective security controls. In particular, I am focusing on automating and improving the Security Operations Center (SOC) while improving my understanding of DevSecOps, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Kubernetes.

I hold a Honour's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Pretoria, and international certifications such as OSCP, CRT, AWS SAA and more, which are linked [below](#accreditations).

Prior to Wayfair, my work experience consisted of:

- Cloud Security Researcher at [eSentire](https://esentire.com/) focusing on the implementation of detective security controls for eSentire’s XDR solution. In particular, I was responsible for determining the cloud security roadmap for eSentire and then creating threat detections across all major cloud providers and container based environments based on the roadmap.

- A Senior Cyber Security Consultant at [MWR CyberSec](https://mwrcybersec.com/) (previously F-Secure Consulting), with a focus on delivering strategic Cloud and Active Directory (AD) based security assessments. The assessments encompassed all aspects within the Cyber Kill-Chain across large corporate networks and environments in order to provide meaningful security hardening recommendations. 

- Security Operations Centre (SOC) manager for a large financial institution in South Africa, my responsibilities included the day-to-day management of the SOC, and consolidating and improving the effectiveness of the security monitoring capability through the design and implementation of a transformation roadmap spanning people, processes and technology. 

## Favourite Quote
My favourite quote is from former Coca-Cola CEO, Bryon Dyson:

> Imagine life as a game in which you are juggling some five balls in the air. You name them — work, family, health, friends and spirit — and you’re keeping all of these in the air.
> 
> You will soon understand that work is a rubber ball. If you drop it, it will bounce back.
> 
> But the other four balls — family, health, friends and spirit — are made of glass. If you drop one of these, they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged or even shattered. They will never be the same.
> 
> You must understand that and strive for balance in your life
