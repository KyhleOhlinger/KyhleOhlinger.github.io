I am currently a Cloud Security Researcher at [eSentire](https://www.esentire.com/) focusing on the implementation of detective security controls for eSentire's XDR solution. In particular, I am focusing on creating Novel Multi-Signal Threat Detectors coupled with appropriate response actions across cloud and container based environments.

I hold a Honour's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Pretoria, and international certifications such as OSCP, CRT, AWS SAA and more, which are linked [below](#accreditations).

Previous to eSentire, I was:

- A Senior Cyber Security Consultant at [MWR CyberSec](https://mwrcybersec.com/) (previously F-Secure Consulting), with a focus on delivering strategic Cloud and Active Directory (AD) based assessments. The assessments encompassed all aspects within the Cyber Kill-Chain across large corporate networks and environments in order to provide meaningful security hardening recommendations. 

- Security Operations Centre (SOC) manager for a large financial institution in South Africa, my responsibilities included the day-to-day management of the SOC, and consolidating and improving the effectiveness of the security monitoring capability through the design and implementation of a transformation roadmap spanning people, processes and technology. 

## Blog Posts
